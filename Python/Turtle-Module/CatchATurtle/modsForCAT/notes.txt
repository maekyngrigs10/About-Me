what needs to be done

Incorporate a Countdown timer, that when it goes off, the
game will stop and shows the top 5 scores

Every time the turtle moves, change the Screen background
to red and then back to white

When you click the turtle, it will leave a red outline of
where the turtle was

Each time you click the turtle, shrink the turtle by 50% 
until it is at a certain size then reset the size (at least
3 shrinks before reset)

Create a start game function that forces the user to press 
start on the Turtle Screen which will trigger the countdown 
and the ability to click on the turtle

Keep track of the accuracy of clicking.  You can display the
score and the accuracy right below the score.  Accuracy is 
defined by the turtle clicks vs amount of clicks.

Be sure that the turtle will NOT spawn under the scorekeeper
and timekeeper because if so, they cannot be clicked.
